# Pathfinding Visualization Tool

Made out of curiosity and because I wanted to learn Python (my first project with Python). 

## Features

- Visualize how Pathfinding works - step-by-step or finish the process in one click
- Uses Dijkstra's Algorithm (some other algorithms will maybe follow)
- Select what path this program should find - choose where the algorithm starts & stops and create obstacles (legend: blue => start node, violet => stop node, red => solid blocks)

## How to run
Download the Github repository, go into the directory and run the following command with Python 3 (commands can vary):
- On Windows: `python program.py`
- On MacOS: `python3 program.py`
